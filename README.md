# Library Management System  

## Overview  
The **Library Management System** is a relational database project implemented using **SQL**. This project is designed to manage library operations efficiently, including tracking books, members, and transactions.

## Features  
- **Books Table**: Stores information about books, including their title, author, genre, and availability.  
- **Members Table**: Maintains details of library members, such as name, contact information, and membership date.  
- **Transactions Table**: Tracks book issuance and return records, with relationships to books and members.  

## Database Structure  
The database contains the following tables:  
1. **Books**:  
   - `BookID` (Primary Key)  
   - `Title`  
   - `Author`  
   - `Genre`  
   - `PublishedYear`  
   - `CopiesAvailable`  

2. **Members**:  
   - `MemberID` (Primary Key)  
   - `Name`  
   - `Email`  
   - `PhoneNumber`  
   - `MembershipDate`  

3. **Transactions**:  
   - `TransactionID` (Primary Key)  
   - `BookID` (Foreign Key)  
   - `MemberID` (Foreign Key)  
   - `IssueDate`  
   - `ReturnDate`  

## Prerequisites  
- A SQL-compatible database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- Basic knowledge of SQL and database management.  

## Installation and Usage  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/vamsi0804/library-management-system/blob/main/librarymanagementsystem.sql  
   ```  

2. Open the SQL file `librarymanagementsystem.sql` in your database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench).  

3. Run the SQL script to create and populate the database.  

4. Execute queries to analyze and interact with the database.  

## Sample Queries  
- Retrieve all available books:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT * FROM Books WHERE CopiesAvailable > 0;  
   ```  

- Find members who borrowed a specific book:  
   ```sql  
   SELECT Members.Name, Members.Email  
   FROM Transactions  
   JOIN Members ON Transactions.MemberID = Members.MemberID  
   WHERE Transactions.BookID = 1;  
   ```  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add a user authentication system.  
- Implement triggers for automatic updates to `CopiesAvailable` in the Books table.  
- Integrate with a front-end application for a complete library management solution.
